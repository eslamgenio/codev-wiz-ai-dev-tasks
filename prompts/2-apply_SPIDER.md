Now apply Codev’s SP(IDE)R protocol to this repository following the instructions at
https://github.com/ansari-project/codev/blob/main/INSTALL.md

but keep the existing folder structure and integrate Codev’s configs only (no duplicate specs or tasks).
Make sure devflow.py still works, and connect it to Codev’s config if possible.
